# Video Clipper — Trim & Crop Video

Turn a moment from a web video into an MP4 on your computer. Mark IN/OUT, preview the selection, then save. Combine several moments into one video or export each part separately. Crop directly over the original player, choose a phone format, adjust audio and add your watermark.

**English and Italian**, with automatic browser-language selection and an immediate language switch in Settings.

**[Install for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/video-clipper-in-out-mp4/)** · **[Download Windows helper installer](https://github.com/FlamingFury28/video-clipper/releases/download/helper-v1.8.2/VideoClipper-Helper-1.8.2-Windows-Setup.exe)** · **[English setup guide](INSTALL.md)** · **[Guida italiana](INSTALLAZIONE.md)**

## Start clipping

1. Install the extension from Mozilla Add-ons. First installation opens **Guided setup**.
2. On Windows x64, download the helper installer above and click **Install**. It prepares a permanent folder, connects Firefox and reuses installed video tools. If tools are missing, it can download a fixed, SHA-256-verified FFmpeg package from gyan.dev (about 105 MB). No administrator access, Python installation or manual PATH changes.
3. Return to **Settings → Guided setup → Check connection**, choose an output folder, then try a short clip.

**Helper 1.8.2 protects files created by other applications while a clip is being saved.** Complete clips are published without replacing an existing name; a taken name receives a numbered suffix. Separate parts retain their order and cancellation handling. **Extension 1.12.9** points Guided setup to the fixed Windows installer and Linux package. Existing signed extension 1.12.8 is also compatible: update the desktop helper to receive this protection.

**Already installed in Firefox?** Open **Add-ons and themes → gear menu → Check for Updates**. For a signed XPI already downloaded, choose **Install Add-on From File** in the same menu. Keep the installed extension: its settings are preserved. Firefox controls installation and catalog update availability.

## Make it yours

- **Precise parts:** type times, drag IN/OUT, adjust with configurable steps, undo, preview and reorder.
- **One video or several files:** join parts or save numbered MP4 files. Existing files are not overwritten.
- **Crop on the page:** move or resize a simple rectangle over the original video. Choose Original/free, 9:16 phone, 16:9, 1:1 or 4:5 without stretching.
- **Audio and watermark:** change export volume, remove audio, remember your last choice and position a local logo.
- **Names and profiles:** choose the title source, fallback name, prefix/suffix and filename template. Save profiles and projects or queue exports.
- **Fits your browser:** use the Firefox theme palette, native light/dark colors and customizable shortcuts. History opens separately.
- **Help when needed:** configuration checks, privacy-conscious diagnostic reports and bounded source/context recovery.

## Compatibility and limits

The extension works with accessible HTML5 players, embedded frames, open shadow roots and dynamic pages. Choose another player manually when necessary. Source identity and duration checks help prevent saving the wrong video.

The new helper is verified with concurrent native exports, existing foreign files, empty reservations, Unicode titles and separate parts on Windows and Linux. Helper 1.8.2 and signed extension 1.12.9 pass real MP4/HLS exports after permanent browser restart in Windows 11 x64 / Firefox 142.0 and 158.0.1, and Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 / Firefox 158.0.1. Guided setup selects the correct published package on both systems. The full Windows Python suite ran 489 tests: 483 passed and six were skipped, eight targeted publication cases per OS and four Chromium MV3 checks. Previous source/player/background verification remains applicable to unchanged files; the options changes are limited to two download URLs. The guided installer is for **Windows x64**. Linux uses the archive and system FFmpeg; Snap/Flatpak helper access is unverified. No verified helper package is available for macOS, Android or iOS.

Some sites require optional, revocable per-site session access in the authenticated browser context. Advanced search and session access are separate. No other browser profile is read. DRM, live streams and closed shadow roots are unsupported. A full source video may need downloading before trimming. “Original” quality is not lossless. Website compatibility is not universal.

## Privacy and verification

Conversion runs locally. There is no Video Clipper cloud editing or analytics service. Preferences, language choice, projects, watermarks and history stay on your device. Session values are excluded from exported diagnostic reports. Optional version checks contact GitHub; the installer contacts the FFmpeg vendor only when missing tools are requested. Read [Privacy](PRIVACY.md).

The XPI is Mozilla signed. The helper/installer have no separate Authenticode signature; checksums and verification metadata are supplied. This repository contains public documentation and downloads. Project Python sources remain private.
